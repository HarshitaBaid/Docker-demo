#version of the Docker Compose file format
version: '4.29.0'

#defines the services that compose your application
services:

    #Defines a service named 'web'
    web:
        #Specifies the build context(sets of files and directories) for the web service. It builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (.)
        build: .

        #Maps port 5000 of the host to port 5000 of the web service container. This allows access to the web service via http://localhost:5000
        ports:
            - "5000:5000"

        #db as a service needs to be started before web. Docker-compose stop will first stop the api and only then stop the db service.

            - db
    
    db:
        #Docker image to be used for the db service
        image: mysql:5.7
        
        #Sets environment variables required for configuring the MySQL database
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example #Sets the root password for MySQL.
            MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase #Creates a database named mydatabase.
            MYSQL_USER: myuser #Creates a MySQL user named myuser.
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: mypassword #Sets the password for the myuser MySQL user.

        #Maps port 3306 of the host to port 3306 of the db service container
        ports:
            - "3306:3306"

        #Defines a Docker volume named db-data and mounts it to the path /var/lib/mysql inside the db service container. This volume is used to persist the MySQL data, ensuring that the database data is not lost when the container is stopped or restarted

            - db-data:/var/lib/mysql


#This section defines Docker volumes used by the services. Defines a named volume named db-data. This volume is used by the db service to persist MySQL data
