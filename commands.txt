docker ps


#LIST ALL CONTAINER
docker ps -a


#KILL/STOP A CONTAINER
docker stop <name or id>
docker kill <name or id> (if container doesn't stop after 10 seconds then use forceful stop without clean up        resources)


#KILL IMAGE
docker rmi <name or id> (if container is in use, docker will prevent to delete)
docker rmi -f my-image  (if want to forceful delete the image)
docker rmi my-image1 my-image2 abcdef123456 (can specify multiple image or id)



DOCKER COMPOSE


#starts up the services defined in docker-compose.yml file
#creates and attaches to the containers for those services
#build image if image do not exist
docker-compose up

#stops the running services and cleans up resources created by docker-compose up
docker-compose down

#builds or rebuilds the Docker images for services defined in the docker-compose.yml file
docker-compose build

#to start the service in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

#starts the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file without building them
#start existing services without rebuilding
docker-compose start

# stops the running services defined in the docker-compose.yml file without removing them
docker-compose stop

#restarts the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file
#stops and then starts the services
docker-compose restart

#lists the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file and their status (running, stopped, etc.)
docker-compose ps

#displays log output from services defined in the docker-compose.yml file
#can specify a service name to view logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs
docker-compose logs <service_name>

#to build service by creating image even it is already created and in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build

#to run commands inside a container
